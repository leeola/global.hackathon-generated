This is our page
================

We are the Koding team, so we are not really participating. But this page is here
to give you an idea about your own page.


About your team
===========================
Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?

Judges will read this page before making a final decision, so write your story, make it emotional and impressive.
Tell us why you want to win.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Don't reveal too much about your project, this is a competition but maybe
you can tell us the technologies, APIs you are going to use and what kind
of application you are going to build.

You can change your mind, that's ok. Just push an update here when you do.
